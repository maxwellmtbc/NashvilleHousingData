# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project
Data cleaning in SQL using Nashville Housing data

# A brief description of this project...

[Here is the link to the dataset used in this project](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAlexTheAnalyst%2FPortfolioProjects%2Fmain%2FNashville%2520Housing%2520Data%2520for%2520Data%2520Cleaning.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK).

This is a great project to practice data cleaning! You'll get practice parsing, changing date format, populating data using self join, dropping columns, and more!
